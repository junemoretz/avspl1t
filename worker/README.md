# avspl1t Worker

This folder contains the worker implementation for the avspl1t system. Worker instances perform the underlying computational work. By spinning up more worker instances, the capacity of the avspl1t system can be increased, and the end-to-end latency of an encode job can be decreased, through splitting the encoding of different segments among an increased number of workers.
